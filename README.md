# CS-300
A repository of scripting done for my CS 300: Analysis &amp; Design class.

PROJECT 2:
  - Purpose & Goals:
    - Load course information from a CSV file into a course list ADT (vector).
    - Print entire course list in alphanumeric order.
    - Search for and print information regarding a specified course.

  - ADT of choice is the vector, chosen over hash table and binary search tree.
  - No .hpp or other .cpp files required -- all done within one.
  - Utilizes <THREAD> and <CHRONO> as well as Byte Order Mark (BOM) skipping.
    - These were not requirements of the project and were extra for aesthetically
      spacing out console actions/outputs and removing special characters from strings,
      respectively.
