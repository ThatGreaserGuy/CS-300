# CS-300
A repository of scripting done for my CS 300: Analysis &amp; Design class.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROJECT 1:
  - Purpose & Goals:
    - Provide pseudocode for course list requirements similar to Project 2 with the
      added detail of ADT variety focusing on vectors, hash tables, and binary search
      trees.
    - Analyze runtime complexity for the three data structures and display.
    - Compare these runtime complexities as well as pros and cons of each data struc-
      ture.
    - Reflect upon these comparisons and provide an educated recommendation of the
      best data structure to utilize for the given scenario.
  
  - Only file included is the .docx file for the pseudocode, analyses, and comparisons.
  - This is to promote a comprehension followed by critical thinking in implementation.
  - The runtime complexities included do not accurately represent the final product(s)
    as pieces of the project can be interchanged depending on criteria -- one such
    example being prerequisite validation that was not implemented.

PROJECT 2:
  - Purpose & Goals:
    - Load course information from a CSV file into a course list ADT (vector).
    - Print entire course list in alphanumeric order.
    - Search for and print information regarding a specified course.

  - ADT of choice is the vector, chosen over hash table and binary search tree.
  - No .hpp or other .cpp files required -- all done within one.
  - Utilizes <THREAD> and <CHRONO> as well as Byte Order Mark (BOM) skipping.
    - These were not requirements of the project and were extra for aesthetically
      spacing out console actions/outputs and removing special characters from strings,
      respectively.
